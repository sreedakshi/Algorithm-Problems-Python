class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        first = 0
        second = 0

        for n in nums:
            temp = first
            first = second
            second = max(temp + n, second)

        return second

#Time Complexity: O(n) as all the nums in nums are being iterated through one by one. 

#Space Complexity: O(1) as there are only two vars (first and second) being used.
